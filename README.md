## About Me
---

I'm 20 and I love programming since my 8 when I started creating my first HTML pages for pure fun. I have lived in several cities in southern Brazil and I really enjoy traveling and getting to know new cities with new experiences. Currently I work as Front End in a company in the north coast of Rio Grande do Sul and I'm graduated as Systems Analyst and Developer by ULBRA Torres.

Curious born and passionate to learn I'm always trying to improve my skills, discover and test new tools and understand the world of technology as a whole. Also, although I have no certification since I learned on my own, I'm fluent in English

## About the Test
---
I had no difficulty with the test and I took the opportunity to test a component styling tool. I took the liberty to change the name of the placeholder to maintain the standard in English, because in the design file there were some inconsistencies like the placeholder of the field "Name" as "Nome" and in the mobile version two fields for "Phone".

There is a live version of the test available in [surge](https://konecty.surge.sh/).
