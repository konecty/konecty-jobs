## Professional Summary
I was born in Capão da Canoa and I love development since I was 15 years old. I did win a software

championship when I was 16 and I live to develop systems that make people's lives better.

I've moved a few times looking for better oportunities, but always wanting more. I make my choices and I like it.

In the last year, I've been learning and working with Javascript and Angular. Now, I live in Torres in Brazil. Working in small projects by my own.
